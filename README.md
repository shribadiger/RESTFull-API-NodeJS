# Rest API Development in Node JS
REST -- Representational State Transfer. 
It is an architectural design style for distributed systems.
### How Rest API helps in improvement of distributed system
<li> Performance: efficient and simple implementation</li>
<li> scalability of component interaction</li>
<li> Simplicity of Interface</li>
<li> Modification of component</li>
<li> Portability</li>
<li> Reliability because of stateless constraint</li>
<li> Visibility</li>

### REST Constraints:
<li> Client-Server Architecture : The main principle is *separation of concern*. Server will be in
                                charge to handle the request from the client. The client and server code
                                is independent. The change in the Client or Server will not impact on each other.</li>
